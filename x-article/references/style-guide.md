# Ody's X Article Style Guide

Comprehensive writing rules for Phase 3 drafting.

## Voice & Tone

- **Analytical but conversational** - Framework-driven with natural Gen Z vernacular where it fits
- Talk to the reader directly - use "you" and "your"
- Write like explaining to a sharp friend, not presenting to a lecture hall
- **Be unapologetically opinionated** - Take clear stances backed by reasoning
- Use **rhetorical questions** as transitions. "Why?" as standalone paragraph is a power move
- Emphasis formatting (bold, caps, italics) sparingly. Reserve caps for real intensity: "NOW, FAST, before it's too late"
- Strategic emoji use is fine where it adds energy. Don't overdo it

## Ody's Signature Style Elements

Use these frequently but vary order, context, application. Should feel like Ody, not filling a template:

### → Chains for Causality
```
Technology emerges → Incumbents dismiss it → Startups win
```

### Named Frameworks
If you spot a pattern, give it a title. Named concepts get quoted and shared.
Examples: "The Cinderella Glass Slipper Effect," "The Maslow Trap"

### Contrast Pairs with Parenthetical Inversions
Define by negation:
- "Consensus adoption (not dismissal)"
- "Labor replacement pricing (not per-seat)"

### Cold Lines
Short, blunt sentences after analytical buildup for tonal contrast:
- "That's the bar."
- "The university wasn't a ladder. It was a gate."

### Academic-to-Casual Bridge
Reference Christensen or Caplan in one breath, then drop "lol" or "touches grass" in the next. Credible sources + natural vernacular is the signature.

## Paragraph & Formatting Rules

- **Short paragraphs: 1-4 lines max.** Many best paragraphs are 1-2 sentences for emphasis
- **One idea per paragraph.** Never cram
- **One sentence per line** where possible - creates natural rhythm, especially on mobile
- **Bold the key insight** in important sections so skimmers catch the core argument
- **Bullets and numbered lists sparingly** - only for data points, frameworks, step-by-step processes. Prose should dominate
- **White space matters.** Dense text blocks feel exhausting before readers start
- Mark visual placements with `[VISUAL: description]` tags inline

## Readability

- **Simplify language radically.** Write like a smart person who chose simple words to be understood, not to impress
- If a 14-year-old couldn't follow the core argument, it's too complex. Dumb it down until it feels almost too simple
- This doesn't mean dumbing down *ideas* - it means making sophisticated analysis accessible through clear language

## Content & Persuasion

- **Every major claim must be followed by evidence.** Stats, examples, case studies, personal observations, before/after comparisons. Never assert without supporting
- **Use specific numbers.** Not "significant growth" but "$10B+ in volume." Not "wages haven't kept up" but "wages grew 8% while housing costs doubled"
- **Include 2-4 quotations** from thinkers, authors, or practitioners. Format as blockquotes
- **Use analogies and metaphors** that make abstract ideas visceral: "invisible bars," "the ladder got pulled up," "scratching at the scab of our higher order needs"
- **Anticipate and address counterarguments.** Acknowledge the other side before dismantling it
- **Include at least one personal anecdote or real story** - especially powerful at opening or closing
- **Make it actionable.** Don't just describe a pattern - show how to apply it. Walk through the process step by step

## Opening (First 3 Paragraphs)

- Sentence one: provocation, stance, or hook. No warmup
  - Examples: "I am not a stock picker." / "If you're anything like me, you think new years resolutions are stupid."
- Paragraphs 2-3: establish stakes. Why should reader care? What's at risk? What's the tension?
- By end of paragraph 3, reader knows what article is about and feels compelled to continue

## Closing (Final Section)

Close with one of these devices:
- Personal anecdote or story that crystallizes the thesis
- Callback to the opening that creates circular, satisfying structure
- Single punchy line that lands like a mic drop
- Provocative question that lingers in reader's mind

If topic has moral/ethical dimensions, include brief honest reflection - don't preach, just acknowledge complexity.

Include call to action where natural: question to spark replies, encourage sharing, or prompt reader to try one thing.
